  <h1>Algebraic expressions</h1>

  <p>An algebraic expression in mathematics is an expression which is made up of variables and constants, along with algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).<br> Examples
    3x + 4y – 7,  4x – 10, etc.

    These expressions are represented with the help of unknown variables, constants and coefficients. The combination of these three (as terms) is said to be an expression. It is to be noted that, unlike the algebraic equation, an algebraic expression has no sides or equal to sign..<br>
    The following figure shows a algebraic expression.

    <p>
      In the above expression (i.e. 5x – 3),

      x is a variable, whose value is unknown to us which can take any value.
      5 is known as the coefficient of x, as it is a constant value used with the variable term and is well defined.
      3 is the constant value term that has a definite value.
