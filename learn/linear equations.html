  <h1>Linear equations</h1>
  <p>Linear equations are equations of the first order. The linear equations are defined for lines in the coordinate system. When the equation has a homogeneous variable of degree 1 (i.e. only one variable), then it is known as a linear equation in one variable. A linear equation can have more than one variable. <br>
    If the linear equation has two variables, then it is called linear equations in two variables and so on. Some of the examples of linear equations are 2x – 3 = 0, 2y = 8, m + 1 = 0, x/2 = 3, x + y = 2, 3x – y + z = 3. <br>
    An equation is a mathematical statement, which has an equal sign (=) between the algebraic expression. Linear equations are the equations of degree 1. It is the equation for the straight line. The solutions of linear equations will generate values, which when substituted for the unknown values, make the equation true. In the case of one variable, there is only one solution.<br>
    Forms of Linear Equation
    The three forms of linear equations are :
    <li>Standard Form</li>
    <li>Slope Intercept Form</li>
    <li>Point Slope Form</li>
