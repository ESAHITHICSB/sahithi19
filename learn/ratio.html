  <h1>Ratio</h1>
  <p>Ratio and Proportion are explained majorly based on fractions. When a fraction is represented in the form of a:b, then it is a ratio whereas a proportion states that two ratios are equal. Here, a and b are any two integers<br>
    In certain situations, the comparison of two quantities by the method of division is very efficient. We can say that the comparison or simplified form of two quantities of the same kind is referred to as a ratio. This relation gives us how many times one quantity is equal to the other quantity. In simple words, the ratio is the number that can be used to express one quantity as a fraction of the other ones.<br>
    The two numbers in a ratio can only be compared when they have the same unit. We make use of ratios to compare two things. The sign used to denote a ratio is ‘:’.

    A ratio can be written as a fraction, say 2/5. We happen to see various comparisons or say ratios in our daily life.<br>
    Hence, the ratio can be represented in three different forms, such as::
    <li>a to b</li>
    <li>a:b</li>
    <li>a/b</li>
