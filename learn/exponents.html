  <h1>Exponents</h1>
  <p>Exponent is defined as the method of expressing large numbers in terms of powers. That means, exponent refers to how many times a number multiplied by itself. <br>
    For example, 6 is multiplied by itself 4 times, i.e. 6 × 6 × 6 × 6. This can be written as 64. Here, 4 is the exponent and 6 is the base. This can be read as 6 is raised to power 4<br>
    The symbol used for representing the exponent is ^. This symbol (^) is called a carrot. For example, 4 raised to 2 can be written as 4^2 or 42. Thus, 4^2 = 4 × 4 = 16.<br>
    Different laws of exponents are described based on the powers they bear.

    Multiplication Law: Bases – multiplying the like ones; add the exponents and keep the base the same.

    When bases are raised with power to another, multiply the exponents and keep the base the same.

    Division Law: Bases – dividing the like ones; subtract the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator Exponent and keep the base the same.

    Let ‘a’ be any integer or a decimal number and ‘m’, ‘n’ are positive integers, that represent the powers to the bases such that the above laws can be written as:
    <li>am. an = a^m+n</li>
    <li>(a^m)^n = a^mn</li>
    <li>(ab)^n = an.bn</li>
    <li>(a/b)^n = a^n/b^n</li>
    <li>a^m/a^n = a^m-n</li>
    <li>a^m/a^n = 1/a^n-m</li>
  </p>
